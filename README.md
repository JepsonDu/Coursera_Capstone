## Analysis Report
----
# Background
- Every year, 55 million tourists pour into New York City, attracted by its vast options for entertainment, shopping and dining. With 25,000 eating and drinking establishments spread throughout the five boroughs, restaurants are a vital part of the economy, not only providing jobs but luring professionals from other industries to move to the city for its vibrant social life.

- But in a city that’s more competitive than ever, the restaurant industry has been hurting as it attempts to keep up with rising costs and diners’ expectations of top quality at reasonable prices. “The cost to operate a restaurant has been skyrocketing and, in general, the business environment continues to become tougher and tougher,” said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance. “Beloved restaurants have closed over the years because they just can’t afford to keep their doors open.”

- So The selection of the location to the restaurant is much more important in this world that full of competetive.

# Data Source:
